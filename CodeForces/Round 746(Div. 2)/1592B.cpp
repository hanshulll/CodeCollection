//The answer is always "YES" If n≥2∗x because you can reorder the array as you want.

//Otherwise, You can swap the first n−x elements and the last n−x elements, so you can reorder them as you want but the rest have to stay in their positions in the sorted array.

//So if elements in the subarray [n−x+1,x] in the original array are in their same position after sorting the array then the answer is YES, otherwise NO.
