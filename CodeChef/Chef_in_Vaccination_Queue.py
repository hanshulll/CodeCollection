# CODECHEF - CHEF IN VACCINATION QUEUE SOLUTION
# There are N people in the vaccination queue, Chef is standing on the Pth position from the front of the queue. 
# It takes X minutes to vaccinate a child and Y minutes to vaccinate an elderly person. Assume Chef is an elderly person.

# You are given a binary array A1,A2,â€¦,AN of length N, where Ai=1 denotes there is an elderly person standing on the
# ith position of the queue, Ai=0 denotes there is a child standing on the ith position of the queue. You are also given 
# the three integers P,X,Y. Find the number of minutes after which Chef's vaccination will be completed.
